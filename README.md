# bacteria-RNG

![Browser Illustration](./repo-media/bacteria-RNG.gif)

Produce pseudo-RNG seeds from hashing images of live bacteria.

This is a proof of concept and the browser implementation does not hash images. Made for [Akvile Terminaite](https://2020.rca.ac.uk/students/akvile-terminaite)'s *Bacteria as a Digital Mediator* (2020).

However, server/rng.py includes a difference hashing algorithm that is fully functional.
