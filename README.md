# bacteria-RNG

Currently the browser implementation loads image, randomises arbitrary string and produces random number 1-100. This is only to convey the idea. rng.py includes a difference hashing algorithm that is fully functional.

TO DO: write documentation, link rng.py to browser, devise data feed from bacteria, etc.
