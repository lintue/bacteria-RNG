# bacteria-RNG

Currently the browser implementation loads image, randomises arbitrary string and displays random number 1-100. This is only to convey the idea!

However, *server/rng.py* includes a difference hashing algorithm that is fully functional.

TO DO: write documentation, link rng.py to app, devise data feed from bacteria, etc.
